# Arduino and Processing Serial Link
Examples of serial links between various configurations of Arduino and Processing.

Written and tested with:
* Arduino 1.0.5
* Processing 2.1.1
* Arduino UNO, 2560
* MacOSX Mavericks

## Processing to Arduino
Provides a serial link, sending and receiving, between a computer running Processing and an Arduino.

### Arduino Side
Broadcasts byte 255 until it hears a reply. Then, listens for incoming bytes, and sends them back.

### Processing Side
Listens for byte 255 from an Arduino. After hearing 255, sends randomly generated bytes between 0 and 100 at a rate specified by frameRate(N). Prints sent bytes and any received bytes.

## Arduino to Arduino (to be created in a future commit)
Two Arduinos. One is the master and the other is the slave.

***

## Processing to Arduino to Arduino  (to be created in a future commit)
Processing and two Arduinos in a daisychain configuration. Different serial ports are used. Processing and Arduino 1 are on a separate serial link from Arduino 1 and Arduino 1.
